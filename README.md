# EventHub: A Dynamic Course & Event Platform
EventHub is a feature-rich, front-end application that simulates a real-world platform for discovering, managing, and analyzing educational courses and events. Built with clean HTML, modern Tailwind CSS, and robust vanilla JavaScript, it provides a seamless and interactive experience for three distinct user roles: Students, Event Providers, and Administrators.
